This project aims to explore and extract meaningful information from GitHub data using statistical and exploratory techniques, with an implementation in the Monte Carlo (MC) code.

## Project Structure 

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide in-depth analysis of GitHub data, enabling users to understand development trends, identify the most active contributors, evaluate project popularity, and detect relationships between different projects hosted on the platform.

## Key Features

1. **Temporal Trends Analysis:** Explore how GitHub project development has evolved over time using statistical methods.

2. **Identification of Active Contributors:** Identify the most active contributors on different projects, highlighting their impact in the open-source community.

3. **Evaluation of Project Popularity:** Use metrics to assess project popularity, such as the number of stars, forks, and resolved issues.

4. **Detection of Project Relationships:** Explore links and dependencies between GitHub projects to understand how they interact with each other.

## Using Monte Carlo Code

The Monte Carlo (MC) code language was chosen for its efficiency in simulating random behaviors, which can be useful in analyzing certain characteristics of GitHub data.

### Example Usage:

```mc
import github_data_analytics as gda

# Load GitHub data
data = gda.load_github_data("username/project_name")

# Analyze temporal trends
trend_analysis = gda.perform_temporal_analysis(data)

# Identify active contributors
active_contributors = gda.identify_active_contributors(data)

# Evaluate project popularity
popularity_metrics = gda.evaluate_project_popularity(data)

# Detect project relations
project_relations = gda.detect_project_relations(data)
